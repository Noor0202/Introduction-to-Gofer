"# Introduction-to-Gofer" 
Guys, I am sharing my index.gs file on here. In which I have write some code from very basic,
In this I have typed some of my code as well as other programs and some questions from the question paper, yes maybe not all, but enough to understand.
Along with the code I have written some notes in plain language, yes those notes will have lots of grammar mistakes. But I hope you understand.

Ok, that's all about the file.

Enjoy The Code....
